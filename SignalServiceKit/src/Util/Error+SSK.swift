/// Our NSError objects have an associatedObject backing `NSError.isRetryable`, but our Swift errors do not inherit that.

///
///    enum MyError: Error {
///        case .foo
///    }
///    assert((foo as NSError).isRetryable == false)
///   (foo as NSError).isRetryable = true // <-- Doesn't do what you think it does!
///   operation.reportError(foo)
///    assert((foo as NSError).isRetryable == false) // <-- STILL false!
///
///  In the above case, `foo` remains untouched because `(foo as NSError)` creates a new instance of NSError, so when we're setting
/// `isRetryable`, it's on that new instance, while foo remains untouched.
///
/// On the other hand, this works:
///
///    let nsError = foo as NSError
///    nsError.isRetryable = true
///    reportError(nsError)
///
/// But better yet, is to prefer reporting instances that conform to OperationError.
