## Contributor agreement

Apple requires contributors to iOS projects to relicense their code on submit. We'll have to have individual contributors sign something to enable this.

Our volunteer legal have put together a form you can sign electronically. So no scanning, faxing, or carrier pigeons involved. How modern:

Please go ahead and sign, putting your github username in "Address line #2", so that we can accept your pull requests at our heart's delight.

## Code Conventions

Follow all [Signal-iOS Code Conventions](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
